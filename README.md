# COSC-4P02 Chatbot Project
## Overview
The product will be a software chatbot application. This will be available either as a web app or a standalone application. The product will allow interface between a user interface, where end users can log in, and interact with the chat bot. An API which will be used to provide data through various parts of the product. A database for storing data on the summer games, brock information, and user accounts and history. Finally, the product will implement a natural language processor which will be used to provide responses to users' questions and provide accurate and informative information.

## Framework
The interface should be accessible through various means, a webapp will be implemented that will allow support for all devices with an internet browser. Anyone with a mobile phone, laptop, desktop, or tablet will be able to access the full functionality of the product. The front end will be made to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.

The API will be the major data handler of the system. Data pulled into the database will flow into the database using the API, data requested from the front end will access API endpoints that will securely retrieve relevant information from the DBMS. Login and security will be handled security with the API as well. Furthermore, the natural language processor will feed responses and queries back and forth via this API. 

The DBMS system used will simply store multiple tables with the appropriate information. Schedule timings, events, as well as tables for user information and history of chat messages. All of these will be queryable and editable with the proper authority. The database logs will facilitate bug fixing and future maintenance of the product.

Finally, the natural language processor is the fundamental point of the product. This will interact with the database as well as the frontend to understand user queries and return appropriate information. The algorithm should be able to understand simple questions and should be able to access relevant information from the database.
